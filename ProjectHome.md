Example of how to implement service that plays short audio file every 60 seconds. This should be tested with screen off and usb cable disconnected.

NOTE: before running the app, please copy note.wav from ./assets folder to your root sdcard folder. Basically it should be copied as /mnt/sdcard/note.wav (this is hardcoded path for audio file).
